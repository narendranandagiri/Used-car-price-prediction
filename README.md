Data analytics and Prediction model for Used Cars data

# Dataset Introduction:
Used Car Price Prediction Dataset is a comprehensive collection of automotive information extracted from the popular automotive marketplace website, https://www.cars.com. This dataset comprises 4,009 data points, each representing a unique vehicle listing, and includes nine distinct features providing valuable insights into the world of automobiles.

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
How well those variables describe the price of a car.
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market. So, put on your seatbelt and get ready for a fun journey. We're about to explore the world of cars, solve mysteries, and have a good laugh along the way!

Brand & Model: Identify the brand or company name along with the specific model of each vehicle.
Model Year: Discover the manufacturing year of the vehicles, crucial for assessing depreciation and technology advancements.
Mileage: Obtain the mileage of each vehicle, a key indicator of wear and tear and potential maintenance requirements.
Fuel Type: Learn about the type of fuel the vehicles run on, whether it's gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid.
Engine Type: Understand the engine specifications, shedding light on performance and efficiency.
Transmission: Determine the transmission type, whether automatic, manual, or another variant.
Exterior & Interior Colors: Explore the aesthetic aspects of the vehicles, including exterior and interior color options.
Accident History: Discover whether a vehicle has a prior history of accidents or damage, crucial for informed decision-making.
Clean Title: Evaluate the availability of a clean title, which can impact the vehicle's resale value and legal status.
Price: Access the listed prices for each vehicle, aiding in price comparison and budgeting.
This dataset is a valuable resource for automotive enthusiasts, buyers, and researchers interested in analyzing trends, making informed purchasing decisions or conducting studies related to the automotive industry and consumer preferences. Whether you are a data analyst, car buyer, or researcher, this dataset offers a wealth of information to explore and analyze.
